# DAGs directory — place your Airflow pipeline DAG files here
# 
# Each .py file in this directory is automatically picked up by Airflow.
# DAGs can import backend service code via the mounted volume:
#   ./backend/src → /opt/airflow/src  (configured in compose.yml)
#
# Example DAGs to create later:
#   arxiv_pipeline.py     - Weekly ArXiv paper fetch, parse, embed, index
#   reindex_pipeline.py   - Full re-indexing of all papers
