# Airflow extra dependencies for ResearchHub DAGs
# 
# NOTE: Do NOT add apache-airflow or apache-airflow-providers-* here.
# Airflow and its providers are already installed in the Dockerfile via:
#   pip install "apache-airflow[postgres]==2.10.3" --constraint <constraint_url>
# Adding providers here would pull in a newer incompatible Airflow version.
#
# Only add libraries that DAGs need to import backend service code:

# HTTP and data handling
requests>=2.32.3
httpx>=0.28.1
python-dateutil>=2.9.0.post0

# Database clients (for DAGs that read/write directly)
psycopg2-binary>=2.9.10
redis>=5.0.0

# OpenSearch client (for RAG indexing DAGs)
opensearch-py>=2.4.0

# Pydantic (for data validation in DAGs)
pydantic>=2.0.0
pydantic-settings>=2.0.0

# LLM / RAG stack (for embedding DAGs)
